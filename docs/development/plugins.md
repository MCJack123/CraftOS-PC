# Plugin System
CraftOS-PC features a new plugin system that allows importing external Lua libraries into the ComputerCraft environment. Many pre-existing Lua libraries work out of the box, including some LuaRocks. A CCEmuX adapter plugin is avaiable with all binary versions of CraftOS-PC v2.2 and later.

## Installing
Plugins can be installed in these locations depending on your platform:
* Windows: `C:\Program Files\CraftOS-PC\plugins`
* macOS: `CraftOS-PC.app/Contents/PlugIns`
* Linux: `/usr/share/craftos/plugins`

The plugin file should have the name that the library's `luaopen_` function uses. For example, the CCEmuX plugin should be named `ccemux` because the loader function is named `luaopen_ccemux`. For some plugins (such as Lua libraries), this is required, but some (like the CCEmuX plugin) will tell CraftOS-PC what name to use automatically. Once a plugin is installed it will be available as a global API with the same name as the plugin.

## Using Lua libraries
CraftOS-PC can automatically import Lua libraries as they would be used with standard Lua. Even though CraftOS-PC uses its own version of Lua, you can still use libraries that were built for standard Lua 5.1.

To use a Lua library with CraftOS-PC, simply drop the DLL/dylib/so file into the `plugins` folder as listed above, and rename it so it starts with `lua_` (e.g. `lua_zlib.dll`). This will tell CraftOS-PC not to search for plugin metadata, and instead treats it like a standard library. Make sure to keep the rest of the file name the same, as this is what CraftOS-PC uses to determine the library's name.

## Writing plugins
A plugin consists of three main functions: `plugin_init`, `luaopen`, and `plugin_deinit`. `plugin_init` is called on the main thread when CraftOS-PC starts up, before any computers are started. It receives a pointer to a `PluginFunctions` structure (see below), and the path to the library as a `path_t` reference.It returns a pointer to a `PluginInfo` structure with the plugin's information filled in. This pointer can either be a static reference, or a dynamically allocated pointer (make sure to deallocate it in `plugin_deinit`, though).

The signature for `plugin_init` is:
```c++
PluginInfo * plugin_init(const PluginFunctions * func, const path_t& path);
```

`luaopen` is the main opener function that is used to initialize the API. It's called on the computer thread every time a computer boots up (this may be after a reboot!). It is a standard C Lua function, and is called in the same way as a normal Lua library opener. It takes one string - the API name - on the stack, and returns a value with which to set the API global to. The function should be named `luaopen_<name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the API. `<name>` is normally inferred from the plugin file's name, but if `PluginInfo.apiName` or `PluginInfo.luaopenName` is set, it will use that field instead.

`plugin_deinit` is called on the main thread before CraftOS-PC quits. It can also be called immediately after `plugin_init` if an error was returned (however, it's not called if an exception is thrown). It takes the pointer returned from `plugin_init`, and returns nothing. `plugin_deinit` is not required for a plugin to work, but it can be used if you need to free resources or to delete a dynamically allocated `PluginInfo` structure.

The signature for `plugin_deinit` is:
```c++
void plugin_deinit(PluginInfo * info);
```

All of these functions should be declared as exported C functions. This means they should be inside an `extern "C"` block, and on Windows have the `__declspec(dllexport)` qualifier. Examples of plugins, as well as some starter files, are contained inside the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/MCJack123/craftos2/tree/master/examples) of the CraftOS-PC repository.

## `PluginFunctions` structure

The [PluginFunctions](#PluginFunctions-structure) structure is used to hold all of the functions that a plugin may use to interact with CraftOS-PC. This structure is passed (as a constant pointer) to the `plugin_init` function.

There are two different version fields in this structure. The first, abi_version, is used to determine the version of the ABI. Changes to this version indicate a fundamental incompatibility, and you should not continue loading if this version doesn't match the expected version.

The second field, structure_version, is used to determine what functions are exported in both the Computer and [PluginFunctions](#PluginFunctions-structure) structure. This version is bumped when new fields are added to one of the structure definitions. Check this field before using any fields added after structure version 0. It is not required that this field exactly match - as long as the version is greater than or equal to the minimum that your plugin requires to function, you may continue loading.

Do NOT rely on any non-version-0 fields to exist without checking the structure version. If you do this, users using your plugin on an old version of CraftOS-PC will likely experience a segmentation fault/crash when the plugin attempts to load the non-existing function. Instead, you should check that the structure version is compatible, and warn or error that the plugin is incompatible with the current version (without crashing).

Do note that if your plugin doesn't require any CraftOS-PC structures during initialization, you can let CraftOS-PC handle version checks by returning an info structure with the required versions filled in (see below). If the version numbers don't match, CraftOS-PC will stop loading your plugin. However, this will not suffice if you need to access the structures in your plugin_init.

You may see references to version numbers in the form xx.yy - this is a shorthand form to represent &lt;abi_version&gt;.&lt;structure_version&gt;.

## `PluginInfo` structure

The [PluginInfo](#PluginInfo-structure) structure is used to hold information about a plugin. This structure is returned by plugin_init to indicate some properties about the plugin. The default values in this structure will not change any functionality - feel free to leave them at their default values, or change them to configure your plugin.

### `unsigned `[`abi_version`](#PluginInfo-structure_1af579acc308b2f0c4b3857ede9354e57c) 

The required ABI version for the plugin. Defaults to the version being built for.

### `unsigned `[`minimum_structure_version`](#PluginInfo-structure_1a88675eff27d38e66275a56f9492eac42) 

The minumum required structure version. Defaults to 0 (works with any version).

### `std::string `[`luaopenName`](#PluginInfo-structure_1a1d59ab02a59133cc561cbd30d6a1078c) 

The name of the `luaopen` function. This may be useful to be able to rename the plugin file without breaking `luaopen`.

### `std::string `[`failureReason`](#PluginInfo-structure_1a35dd0cfbb0a7c2a2c6eed3ad064f3591) 

This can be used to trigger a load failure without throwing an exception. Set this field to any non-blank value to stop loading.

### `std::string `[`apiName`](#PluginInfo-structure_1a6390d8dd5af9a537fba6e6be3e2601fd) 

The name of the API. This can be used to override the default, which is determined by filename. This will also affect luaopenName if that's not set.

### `inline  `[`PluginInfo`](#PluginInfo-structure_1a37a95afcb45254a6b59f8d6cf0fcec15)`(const std::string & api,unsigned sv)` 

Returns a dynamically-allocated error info structure. Make sure you have a `plugin_deinit` function in place first.

#### Parameters
* `api` The name of the API.

* `sv` The minimum structure version required for the plugin; defaults to 0.

### ABI compatibility
When compiling plugins, you must use a compiler that is compatible with CraftOS-PC.
* On Windows, CraftOS-PC is built with Visual Studio 2019. You may build plugins for Windows with Visual Studio 2015, 2017, or 2019, or Clang. You may not use MinGW to build plugins.
* On macOS, CraftOS-PC is built with Clang 12 using libc++. You may build plugins for macOS with Clang. You may not use GCC to build plugins, unless you manually link with libc++.
* On Linux, CraftOS-PC is built with GCC using libstdc++. You may build plugins for Linux with GCC 3.4.0+, or Clang with libstdc++ (default, or use `-stdlib=libstdc++`).

#### API versions
| API Version | Structure Version | CraftOS-PC Version |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| (none)      | (none)            | v2.0 - v2.1.3      |
| 2           | (none)            | v2.2 - v2.3.4      |
| 3           | (none)            | Accelerated v2.2   |
| 4           | (none)            | v2.4 - v2.4.5      |
| 10          | 0                 | v2.5 - Current     |
| 11          | 0                 | Accelerated v2.5 - Current |

*Note: When building for debug targets on Windows, add 100000 to the plugin version.*
