# Contact
I am open to bug reports and suggestions for CraftOS-PC, and I can provide help if you are having trouble using it. Here are some ways you can contact me:

* Please file an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MCJack123/craftos2/issues) if you are experiencing bugs in CraftOS-PC. I often check this for any new issues, and most bugs are fixed within a day or two.
* If you have any suggestions, you can also post it on the issue tracker with the enhancement label. I will consider your request and if I approve of it then I'll add it in.
* The preferred method for any other contact is through Discord on the [Minecraft Computer Mods](https://discord.computercraft.cc) server. I am `@JackMacWindows#9776`, and you can ping me there for help with CraftOS-PC.
* If you don't have Discord (or prefer not to use it), you can send me an email at `jackmacwindowslinux+craftospc@gmail.com`, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
